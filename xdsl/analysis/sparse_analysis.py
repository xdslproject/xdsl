    Protocol for the mathematical lattice value types used within Lattice wrappers.
    A lattice is a mathematical structure with a partial ordering and two operations:

    - join (∨): computes the least upper bound (union of information)
    - meet (∧): computes the greatest lower bound (intersection of information)

    Classes implementing this protocol should provide implementations for the `meet` and/or `join` methods.

    This protocol represents the actual lattice element (the abstract value being
    tracked), separate from the propagation infrastructure. For example:

    - In constant propagation: the lattice value might be `⊥ (bottom) | Constant(n) | ⊤ (top)`
    - In sign analysis: the lattice value might be `Positive | Negative | Zero | Unknown`
    - In range analysis: the lattice value might be `Interval(min, max)`

        Computes the greatest lower bound (intersection of information) of two lattice values.

        `a.meet(b)` (or `a ∧ b`) produces the most precise value that is less than or equal
        to both `a` and `b` in the lattice ordering. It represents the combination of two
        abstract values where we keep only information guaranteed to hold in both.

        In other words, `meet` refines information by taking their common part.

        Examples:

        - In constant propagation: `Constant(3) ∧ Constant(3) = Constant(3)`,
          but `Constant(3) ∧ Constant(4) = ⊥ (bottom)`
        - In sign analysis: `Positive ∧ NonZero = Positive`

        In other words, `join` generalizes information by taking their union.

    """
    Base class for sparse lattice elements attached to SSA values.

    This class implements the infrastructure for propagating lattice changes through
    the data flow analysis framework. When a lattice element changes (e.g., a value
    becomes a known constant), this class ensures that:

    1. All operations that use this SSA value are re-analyzed
    2. Subscribed analyses are notified of the change
    3. The solver's work queue is updated appropriately

    The propagation follows use-def chains: when a lattice attached to an SSA value
    changes, all operations that use that value are marked for re-visiting by any
    analyses that have subscribed to this lattice.

    Subclasses must implement the lattice operations (join/meet) and can override
    on_update() to customize propagation behavior beyond simple use-def chains.

    For the concept of lattices in data flow analysis, see
    [`PropagatingLattice`][xdsl.analysis.sparse_analysis.PropagatingLattice].

    Use this as a base class when you need custom propagation logic (e.g., tracking
    equivalence classes, pointer aliases, or context-sensitive information). For
    simple cases, use the Lattice wrapper instead.
