"""
Signed numbers are stored as Two's complement, meaning that the highest bit is used as
the sign. Here's a table of values for a three-bit two's complement integer type:

|------|----------|--------|----------|
| bits | unsigned | signed | signless |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
|  000 |     0    |   +0   |    +0    |
|  001 |     1    |   +1   |    +1    |
|  010 |     2    |   +2   |    +2    |
|  011 |     3    |   +3   |    +3    |
|  100 |     4    |   -4   | +4 or -4 |
|  101 |     5    |   -3   | +5 or -3 |
|  110 |     6    |   -2   | +6 or -2 |
|  111 |     7    |   -1   | +7 or -1 |

We follow LLVM and MLIR in having a concept of signless integers:

https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Rationale/Rationale/#integer-signedness-semantics

The main idea is to not have the signedness be a property of the type of the value,
and rather be a property of the operation. That means that a signless value can be
interpreted as either a signed or unsigned value at runtime, depending on the
operation that acts on it.

During interpretation, this gets a little tricky, as the same bit pattern can be
interpreted as two runtime values, meaning that comparing signless values is a little
involved. For example, a signless value of 5 is equal to a signless value of -3, since
their bit representations are the same.
