## A Python-native Compiler Toolkit

Design your own (domain-specific) compiler by mixing predefined IRs with your
custom IR abstractions. Always optimize at the optimal abstraction level by
lowering programs through multiple levels of IRs. Connect with the LLVM/MLIR
ecosystem while benefiting from Python's productivity.
