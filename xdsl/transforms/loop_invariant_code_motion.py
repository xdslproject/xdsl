"""
This pass hoists operation that are invariant to the loops.

Similar to MLIR's loop invariant code motion:

https://mlir.llvm.org/doxygen/LoopInvariantCodeMotion_8cpp_source.html

An operation is loop-invariant if it depends only of values defined outside of the loop.
LICM moves these operations out of the loop body so that they are not computed more than
once.

    for j in range(0, M, K):    ---->        c[i]= A[1] + b[1]
      c[i]=A[1]+b[1]
