# Marimo Notebooks

This folder is for Python notebooks created with the [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) tool.

These can be run as apps with `marimo run path/to/notebook.py`, as interactive development environments with `marimo edit path/to/notebook.py`, or as headless scripts with `python path/to/notebook.py`.

With the Marimo VSCode extension, they can also be launched within the IDE in either "run" or "edit" modes.
