"""
The High-Level Fortran IR (HLFIR) dialect that is used by Flang.

This is mixed with FIR, and provides a higher level view of Fortran
variables and some expressions. This means that temporaries need not
be materialised and there is a higher level of information about
the programmer's Fortran code, compared to FIR, available for
optimisation and lowering.

    Tie the properties of a Fortran variable to an address. The properties

    The main difference with fir.declare is that hlfir.declare returns two
    values:
      - the first one is an SSA value that allows retrieving the variable
        address, bounds, and type parameters at any point without requiring
        access to the defining operation. This may be:
        - for scalar numerical, logical, or derived type without length
          parameters: a fir.ref<T> (e.g. fir.ref<i32>)
        - for scalar characters: a fir.boxchar<kind> or fir.ref<fir.char<kind,
          cst_len>>
        - for arrays of types without length parameters, without lower bounds,
          that are not polymorphic and with a constant shape:
          fir.ref<fir.array<cst_shapexT>>
        - for all non pointer/non allocatable entities: fir.box<T>, and
          fir.class<T> for polymorphic entities.
        - for all pointers/allocatables:
          fir.ref<fir.box<fir.ptr<T>>>/fir.ref<fir.box<fir.heap<T>>>
      - the second value has the same type as the input memref, and is the
        same. If it is a fir.box or fir.class, it may not contain accurate
        local lower bound values. It is intended to be used when generating FIR

    The optional "realloc" flag allows indicating that this assignment

    In such case, the left hand side must be an allocatable that may be
    unallocated or allocated with a different type and shape than the right
    hand side. It will be allocated or re-allocated as needed during the
    assignment.

    When "realloc" is set and this is a character assignment, the optional
    flag "keep_lhs_length_if_realloc" indicates that the character
    left hand side should retain its length after the assignment. If the
    right hand side has a different length, truncation and padding will
    occur. This covers the case of explicit and assumed length character
    allocatables.

    Otherwise, the left hand side will be allocated or reallocated to match the
    right hand side length if they differ. This covers the case of deferred
    length character allocatables.

    The optional "temporary_lhs" flag indicates that the LHS is a compiler
