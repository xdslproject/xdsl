# Background
# ==========
#
# We want to allow users to write non-SSA code. For example, the frontend should
# allow functions like this:
#
# ```
# def foo() -> i32:
#   a: i32 = 0
#   for i in range(100):
#     a = a + 2
#   return a
# ```
#
# The solution is to have a `symref` dialect: it uses declare, fetch and store
# operations (for those familiar with LLVM, these correspond to `alloca`, `load`
# and `store` but based on symbols instead of memory locations). Each symref
# operation is defined by the programmer with a simple mapping:
#
# 1. variable declaration, e.g. `a: i32 = 0` maps to `declare @a`
# 2. variable use, e.g. `... = a` maps to `... = fetch @a`
# 3. variable assignement, e.g. `a = ...` maps to `update @a ...`
#
# With these, it is relatively straightforward to lower any Python program to
# xDSL (taking care of scoping rules, of course). For example, the code above
# would become (in a slightly abused xDSL syntax):
#
# ```
# func foo() -> i32 {
#   declare @a
#   update @a with 0
#   for 0 to 100 {
#     t1 = fetch @a
#     t2 = add t1 2
#     update @a t2
#   }
#   t3 = fetch @a
#   return t3
# }
# ```
#
# Note that while insertion of symref operations is easy, the generated xDSL is
# not fully in SSA form. For example, blocks in region should pass values
# between each other via block arguments, instead of symref calls. Similarly,
# some operations like scf.if or affine.for should yield a value.
#
#
# Desymrefication pass
# ====================
#
# In this file, we implement desymrefication pass - it goes over generated xDSL
# and removes all symref operations. To describe how the pass works, first
# recall that in xDSL an operation can contain regions which in turn can contain
# CFGs of basic blocks. An operation passes control flow to a region and on exit
# from the region the control flow returns to the operation. Then the operation
# can transfer control flow to another region, etc.
#
# Desymrefication can be applied to regions and operations. First, consider a
# simple case when all operations in the region do not have any nested regions.
# This means that the region is simply a CFG. Otherwise, there are some
# operations that contain regions. However, we can apply desymrefication to
# these operations them first, reducing the problem to the the first case. In
# pseudocode, that would look like:
#
# ```
# desymref_region(region):
#   for block in region.blocks:
#     for op in block.ops:
#       desymref_op(op)
#     # at this point no op contains a symref operation
#     # in the nested region.
# ```
#
# Next, we describe how desymrefication actually works, on a high level.
# Every region either declares a symbol or uses it from the parent region.
# Let's consider each case separately.
#
# Case 1: Symbol is declared in this region. This is an easy case. We already
# know that symbol is only used in this region and no other nested region uses
# it. Therefore running any SSA-construction algorithm on the CFG is enough.
#
# Case 2: Symbol is not declared in this region. In this case, we only support
# non-CFGs at the moment (i.e. single block regions). We observe that in general
# every symbol can be simplified within a block to have at most one fetch (start
# of the block) at most one update (end of the block). This means that using
# specification of an operation we can promote these symbols outside.
# TODO: Add op promotion.
