# WGPU README

Just a temporary Readme file to take notes and communicate ;)

I added a *temporary* wgpu-translate tool; you should get it by just running `pip install -e .` in the xdsl root directory again.
I translated the first example you worked on in a `.mlir` file : `wgpu/examples/simple_copy.mlir`
You can simply `wgpu-translate wgpu/examples/simple_copy.mlir` :)
