class LowerX86ScfForPattern(RewritePattern):
    """
    Inline the for loop body into its parent region, using `Block`s to represent control
    flow. The `Block` containing the `ForOp` is split into two, and the blocks in the
    `body` of the for loop are spliced between them. Additional operations are inserted
    into the block before, and the block after to handle the initialization of the
    iteration argument, and loop-carried variables, as well as control flow. If the for
    loop contained other `riscv_scf` ops, they will have been rewritten by the time this
    rewrite is called. Two comparison operations are inserted, one just before the loop
    blocks, skipping the loop entirely if the condition is not met, and one at the end of
    the loop body, to exit or continue the loop. A canonicalization step may be able to
    eliminate the first check if the bounds are known at compile time.
