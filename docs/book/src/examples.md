# An xDSL program in examples

TODO: Presentation of the IR-based way to model programs, showcase xdsl-opt and how we do transformations in IR programs. This presentation should not go into details of what an operation is. It should only showcase existing operations, how to use them, and the kind of transformations that can be done in xdsl-opt.

TODO: It is important to introduce in this section the intuition that operations do not do anything, they only represent operations. There is no logic behind an operation, it only gets meaning from how it is lowered.
