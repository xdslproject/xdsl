    "## IR Syntax In Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "MLIR is designed to be a completely extensible infrastructure; there is no\n",
    "closed set of attributes (think: constant metadata), operations, or types. MLIR\n",
    "supports this extensibility with the concept of Dialects. Dialects provide a grouping \n",
    "mechanism for abstraction under a unique `namespace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MLIR, `Operations` are the core unit of abstraction and computation, similar in many \n",
    "ways to LLVM instructions. Operations can have application-specific semantics and can be \n",
    "used to represent all of the core IR structures in LLVM: instructions, globals (like \n",
    "functions), modules, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the MLIR assembly for the Toy `transpose` operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mlir\n",
    "%t_tensor = \"toy.transpose\"(%tensor): (tensor<2x3xf64>) -> tensor<3x2xf64>\n",
    "```\n",

    "Let's break down the anatomy of this MLIR operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `%t_tensor`\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   The name given to the result defined by this operation (which includes\n",
    "        [a prefixed sigil to avoid collisions](../../LangRef.md/#identifiers-and-keywords)).\n",
    "        An operation may define zero or more results (in the context of Toy, we\n",
    "        will limit ourselves to single-result operations), which are SSA values.\n",
    "        The name is used during parsing but is not persistent (e.g., it is not\n",
    "        tracked in the in-memory representation of the SSA value).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `\"toy.transpose\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   The name of the operation. It is expected to be a unique string, with\n",
    "        the namespace of the dialect prefixed before the \"`.`\". This can be read\n",
    "        as the `transpose` operation in the `toy` dialect.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `(%tensor)`\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   A list of zero or more input operands (or arguments), which are SSA\n",
    "        values defined by other operations or referring to block arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `(tensor<2x3xf64>) -> tensor<3x2xf64>`\n",
    "\n",

    "        the types of the arguments in parentheses and the type of the return\n",
    "        values afterward.\n",

    "Shown here is the general form of an operation. As described above,\n",
    "the set of operations in MLIR is extensible. Operations are modeled\n",
    "using a small set of concepts, enabling operations to be reasoned\n",
    "about and manipulated generically. These concepts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A name for the operation.\n",
    "-   A list of SSA operand values.\n",
    "-   A list of attributes.\n",
    "-   A list of types for result values.\n",
    "-   A source location for debugging purposes.\n",
    "-   A list of successors blocks (for branches, mostly).\n",

    "## Defining Toy Operations\n",
    "\n",
