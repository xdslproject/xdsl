    "# The Multi-Levelled Approach to Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programming languages are rather far removed from assembly code. As a result, translating a language directly into Assembly is both difficult (easy to make mistakes) and inefficient (generated Assembly code is slow!). Therefore, most compilers go through many intermediate representations / languages (IRs), which represent different layers of abstractions, to provide an efficient translation down to Assembly code - which is also feasible for compiler engineers to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although an effective approach, over the years it has become apparent that many compilers are repeatedly defining similar intermediate languages. Given the separate architecture of different compilers, it has been quite difficult to reuse code between architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous projects such as LLVM have provided a common abstraction layer for different compilers to reuse - however this is only one layer, and compilers of different domains are still having to repeat significant amounts of work to reach the LLVM level.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLVM is also not necessarily the ideal layer to perform optimisations on - thus many compilers will also implement their own implementations on custom IRs before they reach LLVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "xDSL is a frameworks that makes it easy to:\n",
    "1. Define custom abstraction layers for compilers\n",
    "2. Reuse abstractions from other compilers\n",
    "3. Encode domain-specific knowledge (i.e. optimisations) within these abstraction layers\n",
    "\n",
    "xDSL takes inspiration from MLIR, which is a framework based upon similar ideas, and is implemented in C++."

    "The kind of programming languages xDSL defines have the $\\textit{static single assignment}$ (SSA) property. It is a property on variables that means they can be assigned a value only once, and once assigned a value, they cannot be modified. This is a common restriction used within compilers, as it enables many compiler optimisations to be performed.\n",

    "\n",
    "xDSL is a framework for modelling/specifying IRs. Before we go into the details of xDSL, it is perhaps useful to take a step back and consider what exactly an IR is!\n",
    "\n",
    "Code can be represented in a human-readable textual format - however strings are difficult for compilers to handle. An IR is an *equivalent*, structured representation of code convenient for machines to parse through. Importantly, it is solely a representation of the code - is not directly executable on a processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages are often designed for particular tasks and domains, which allows certain optimisations or types of reasoning to take place more easily within the language. A compiler might want to optimise the code in many different ways, and therefore can utilise multiple languages (represented as IR within the compiler) during its translation into machine code.\n",

    "Let's go through each of these additions:\n",
    "1. To specify the names of our table (which is a string), we needed a string type. Taking advantage of the xDSL ecosystem, we can reuse other dialects which already have similar features defined.\n",
    "    - Indeed the `builtin` dialect already has a `StringAttr` attribute defined, and so we use it here for the name of our table.\n",
    "    - Notice we have made the choice to model the table name in the `select(table_name)` operation as an _attribute_ (as seen by `OpAttr[StringAttr]` annotation). This means that table names in our IR must be known at compile time. This is just a design choice we've made, and it's possible to have the `table_name` be an _operand_ instead, which is an SSA value, and thus doesn't need to be known at compile time.\n",
    "2. We specify the _operands_ of the `filter` operation. Here we are saying that `sql.filter` takes in an SSA value.\n",
    "    - We are additionally saying that the SSA value needs to be of type `Bag`, which enables type-check capabilities automatically for our IRs, a feature provided by xDSL.\n",
    "3. We specify the result of our operations - both of our operations should return another SSA value.\n",
    "    - We are also putting type constraints on our return types, this allows xDSL to type-check our IRs."

    "- Operations: we modelled the SQL dialect using `select` and `filter` operations\n",
    "- Attributes: we used attributes to encode compile-time available information, from types (the `Bag` type), to constant expressions (e.g. the \"cmpi\" attribute within `arith.Cmpi`)\n",
    "- Mixing dialects: we utilised features from other dialects (`arith`, `scf`, `builtin`)\n",
    "- Regions and blocks: we used the operation's _regions_ to model the lambda within `sql.filter` since regions allow nesting of code.\n",
    "    - The function arguments are modelled as the _block arguments_ of the first block in the region, and the function's code/computation is represented as the block's list of operations.\n",
    "    - Not all operations need a region, though. For instance `sql.select` does not have a region.\n",
    "- xDSL type-checking: xDSL is able to use the typing information within the dialect definition to validate IRs (through `.verify()` calls)\n",
