    "functions, perform some math computation, and print results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we want to keep things simple, the codegen will be limited to tensors\n",
    "of rank <= 2, and the only datatype in Toy is a 64-bit floating point type (aka\n",
    "‘double’ in C parlance). As such, all values are implicitly double precision,\n",
    "`Values` are immutable (i.e. every operation returns a newly allocated value),\n",
    "and deallocation is automatically managed. But enough with the long description;\n",
